Hello!. I am Ardino Pierfrancesco, a Postdoctoral Researcher (Assegnista di ricerca) at <a href='https://www.stiima.cnr.it/'> STIIMA - CNR </a> in Bari. I'm passionate about Machine Learning and in particular Computer Vision. In these years I've mainly worked on controllable Image and Video Synthesis. Now at STIIMA I'm working on Computer Vision solutions for the Advanced Manufacturing, with a focus in point cloud processing and anomaly detection.
